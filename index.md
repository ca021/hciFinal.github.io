## My HCI Website Portfolio

Welcome to my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) portfolio! I am a senior in Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell University. I took HCI my Fall 2020 semester. I really enjoy web development, so HCI taught me the principles that need to be kept in mind in designs. During my free time this semester, I created a personal website about my study abroad experience in Edinburgh, Scotland. I incorporated the design techniques learned in HCI to make my website usable and accessible. Here you will find demonstrations of each of my projects throughout the course.


### Design Manifesto

The Design Manifesto is a reflection of the work I have completed throughout the semester. It highlights the development of my design philoophy and the principles that I took from it. You can read about my HCI experience [here](https://ca021.medium.com/design-manifesto-499bd64dd28).

### Group Assignments

Throughout the semester, we worked in teams to use the human-centered deisgn process to create new technology. The design assignments had different goals including designing for others, designing for creativity or expression, and deisgning for another world. 


- **Design for Others** The purpose of this design project was to redesign an existing website to cater towards a specific user group. We chose to redesign the CommUnityZone website specifically for donors or organizations wanting to support the establishment in any way. You can read more about our design [here](https://medium.com/@dad044/design-for-others-group-3-111cefff8095).

- **Design for Creativity / Expression** For this project, we developed a web app that teaches people how to do sign language using machine learning. You can learn more about our development process [here](https://medium.com/@dbm030/hci-project-sign-language-fc13548bf04a).

- **Deisgn for Another World** This project gave our group an opportunity to explore virtual reality. Our creation demonstrates the design process used to create a virtual country-rock concert.

### Individual Assignments

Some of the design assignments throughout the course were individual, allowing me to reflect on the principles that I felt were the most important in physical and digital designs.

- **Good Design, Bad Design** Through this project, I explored good and bad designs that I interact with everyday on Bucknell's campus. I reflected on how other people interact with these designs. The Medium article examining the good design is linked [here](https://ca021.medium.com/good-design-7293a5a13ceb) and the bad design is linked [here](https://ca021.medium.com/bad-design-sanitation-station-dfdf57ff8f02).

- **Visualization Critique and Redesign** This assignment focused on 2D output by analyzing an existing information visualization. I chose to critique visualizations from Financial Times and redesigned the visualization based on the faulty points that I critiqued.

## My HCI Website Portfolio

Welcome to my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) portfolio! I am a senior in Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell University. I took HCI my Fall 2020 semester. Here you will find demonstrations of each of my projects throughout the course.


### Design Manifesto




### Group Assignments

Throughout the semester, we worked in teams to use the human-centered deisgn process to create new technology. The design assignments had different goals including designing for others, designing for creativity or expression, and deisgning for another world. 


- **Design for Others** The purpose of this design project was to redesign an existing website to cater towards a specific user group. We chose to redesign the CommUnityZone website specifically for donors or organizations wanting to support the establishment in any way. You can read more about our design [here](https://medium.com/@dad044/design-for-others-group-3-111cefff8095).

- **Design for Creativity / Expression** For this project, we developed a web app that teaches people how to do sign language using machine learning. You can learn more about our development process [here](https://medium.com/@dbm030/hci-project-sign-language-fc13548bf04a).

- **Deisgn for Another World** This project gave our group an opportunity to really explore virtual reality. Our creation demonstrates the design research we put into the decisions we made, the effort that went into creating the user experience we sought, and the utilization of the design process to establish a procedural, incremental path from the start to finish of this project.

### Individual Assignments

Some of the design assignments throughout the course were individual, allowing me to reflect on the principles that I felt were the most important in physical and digital designs.

- **Good Design, Bad Design** Through this project, I explored good and bad designs that I interact with everyday on Bucknell's campus. I reflected on how people interact with an example of a good design and bad design. The Medium article examining the good design is linked [here](https://ca021.medium.com/good-design-7293a5a13ceb) and the bad design is linked [here](https://ca021.medium.com/bad-design-sanitation-station-dfdf57ff8f02).

- **Visualization Critique and Redesign** This assignment focused on 2D output by analyzing an existing information visualization. I chose to critique visualizations from Financial Times and redesigned the visualization based on the faulty points that I critiqued. Follow [this](https://ca021.medium.com/design-critique-redesign-290d87ce4e5b) link to read my critique and the principles used in the redesign.

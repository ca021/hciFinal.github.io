## My HCI Website Portfolio



### Group Assignments

Throughout the semester, we were required to work in teams to complete assigmnents.

- **Design for Others** The purpose of this design project was to redesign an existing website to cater towards a specific user group. We chose to redesign the CommUnityZone website specifically for donors or organizations wanting to support the establishment in any way. You can read more about our design [here](https://medium.com/@dad044/design-for-others-group-3-111cefff8095).

- **Design for Creativity / Expression** For this project, we developed a web app that teaches people how to do sign language using machine learning. You can learn more about our development process [here](https://medium.com/@dbm030/hci-project-sign-language-fc13548bf04a).

- **Deisgn for Another World** This project gave our group an opportunity to really explore virtual reality. Our creation demonstrates the design research we put into the decisions we made, the effort that went into creating the user experience we sought, and the utilization of the design process to establish a procedural, incremental path from the start to finish of this project.

### Individual Assignments

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ca021/hciFinal.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
